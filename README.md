Neural Art Generator 🎨

Welcome to Neural Art Generator, a project that uses deep learning to transform your photos into breathtaking works of art inspired by different artistic styles. Developed with passion and a love for creativity, this project combines the power of neural networks with a touch of artistry.

🌟 Features:

-Art Style Transfer: Apply artistic styles to your photos with the help of deep learning.

-Deep Learning Backbone: Leverages VGG19 for feature extraction and style representation.

-Optimized Performance: Includes color preservation and enhanced image processing.

-Expandable: Designed with future enhancements in mind, including GUI integration and additional style presets.

🚀 How It Works:

1.Load Input Images:

-A content image (your photo) and a style image (art reference).

2.Process with VGG19:

-Extracts content and style features using a pretrained VGG19 model.

3.Style Transfer Algorithm:

-Combines style and content using Gram matrix calculations and optimized loss functions.

4.Generate Artwork:

-Outputs an image blending the content and style beautifully.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

-Programming Language: Python 🐍

-Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Keras

-Image Processing: PIL, Matplotlib

-Optimization: Adam Optimizer

🧑‍💻 Development Journey:

-Inspired by art restoration videos.

-Iteratively improved features like color preservation and loss optimization.

-Designed to be modular for future upgrades (e.g., adding GUI).
